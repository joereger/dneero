    <br/>
    <font class="smallfont">
    Absolutely not!  You should post whatever you actually believe. dNeero will not allow advertisers to bias you in any way.  You are being paid for your time and your opinion... not for any particular opinion.

    <br/>
    <font class="smallfont">
    Yes, they will.  Disclosure is an important element of the blogosphere that dNeero is committed to.  When you post your survey answers to your blog we'll include an unobtrusive but clear note that this survey was paid for.

    <font class="mediumfont" color="#333333">How do blog readers feel about paid blog posts?</font>
    <br/>
    <font class="smallfont">
    Historically blog readers are very comfortable with paid blog posts as long as two conditions are met:
    <ol>
    <li>The fact that the payment is disclosed.</li>
    <li>Any bias created by the payment is discussed and understood.</li>
    </ol>

    <font class="mediumfont" color="#333333">Can I post anything else with my survey answers?</font>
    <br/>
    <font class="smallfont">
    Absolutely!  The survey is just a starting point.  Think of it as a way for advertisers and market researchers to start the conversation with you... and as a way for you to start a conversation with your readers.  Go beyond the survey.  Discuss other thoughts you have about the product, concept, etc.  The more you share with your readers the happier we are.

    <font class="mediumfont" color="#333333">When do I get paid?</font>
    <br/>
    <font class="smallfont">
    Your account balance is updated immediately (or close to immediately).  We then must wait to collect payment from our researchers before we pay you.  We'd like to get a line of credit to foot the bill for bad researchers but at this time we can't do so.  There is some level of risk involved, but we believe it's relatively small and we're always working closely with researchers to make sure they intend to pay.

    <br/>
    <font class="smallfont">
    We want you to invite friends to the system so we're paying you up to #{bloggerEarningsRevshare.level1percent}% of what we pay your friends.  Here's how it works:
    <ul>
      <li><font class="smallfont">We calculate your friend's earnings</font></li>
      <li><font class="smallfont">We pay your friend</font></li>
      <li><font class="smallfont">We pay you up to #{bloggerEarningsRevshare.level1percent}% of your friend's earnings (out of our pocket)</font></li>

    <br/>
    <font class="smallfont">
    Yes. We pay you for the activity of friends of friends up to five levels deep.  The amount we pay is less each level away from you, but those little bits add up.

    <font class="mediumfont" color="#333333">And how is this not a pyramid scheme?</font>
    <br/>
    <font class="smallfont">
    According to <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyramid_scheme'>Wikipedia</a> a pyramid scheme "is a non-sustainable business model that involves the exchange of money primarily for enrolling other people into the scheme, usually without any product or service being delivered."  Wikipedia then continues: "There are other commercial models using cross-selling such as multi-level marketing (MLM) or party planning which are perfectly legal and sustainable." (Quotes as of Oct 31, 2006)
    <br/><br/>
    dNeero does not charge you to take part in the program.  Pyramid schemes often include a hefty up-front charge with the promist of exponential growth from downstream users.
    <br/><br/>
    dNeero does not pay you simply to recruit friends... we pay you a share of our revenue that is generated by your friends.
    <br/><br/>
    Nobody is ever left "holding the bag."  The model is sustainable.  We are simply choosing to share a defined percentage of our revenue with you to attract new users.
    <br/><br/>
    Nobody is ever paying any money for an item of fictional value, as in pyramid schemes where items with little actual value are paid for.  The dNeero system works on the other side of the equation... when we pay you.  There's no "entry price."

    <font class="mediumfont" color="#333333">And dNeero pays me for my friends' activity forever?</font>
    <br/>
    <font class="smallfont">
    At this point, yes.  This is not a "one-time" payment... whenever your friend makes money, you make money.  However we are likely to impose a one or two year limit on the revenue share.</font>

    <br/>
    <font class="smallfont">
    You provide their email addresses and we'll do the rest.  Of course, your friends must click a link we send them.  If they don't use that link to sign up then there's no way to later associate them with your account... so follow-up with your friends and make sure they do things correctly.

    <br/>
    <font class="smallfont">
    Your friend will get paid the same amount whether they sign up alone or through your invitation.  The money paid out from this program comes from dNeero's pockets, not your friends'.

    <br/>
    <font class="smallfont">
    On the homepage we list all surveys... for anybody.  Once you log in we know about you and we can show you only the surveys that you qualify for.  Researchers can target surveys by geographic area, age, etc.
