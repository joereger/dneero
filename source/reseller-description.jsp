<font class="mediumfont" style="color: #999999;">What is the Reseller Program?</font>
<br/><font class="normalfont" style="color: #666666;">
The dNeero Reseller Program allows you to sell Social Surveys to organizations and earn a percentage of whatever they spend on the survey.  For example, if they do a survey and pay $1000 to bloggers and social people through it then you'll earn $100.

<font class="mediumfont" style="color: #999999;">How does it work?</font>
<br/><font class="normalfont" style="color: #666666;">
The program is very simple for you to use.
<ol>
    <li><b>Tell organizations about dNeero.com</b>. Send them email.  Call them on the phone.  Hand out fliers on the street.</li>
    <li><b>Give the business your Reseller Code</b> and tell them to apply it in the last step of survey creation.  Of course, they'll need a dNeero.com account.</li>
    <li><b>Sit back and relax</b>... any time the organization pays a blogger or social person through the survey you'll earn money.  You'll see the amounts added to your dNeero balance automatically.</li>
</ol>

<font class="mediumfont" style="color: #999999;">Sounds good... how do I sign up?</font>
<br/><font class="normalfont" style="color: #666666;">
All you need is a dNeero account.  Anybody can join the Reseller Program!  Once you have a dNeero account you need to log in, click Account and find the Reseller Program link.  On that page you'll learn what your Reseller Code is.

<br/><br/>
<font class="mediumfont" style="color: #999999;">What do you mean by 'organization'?</font>
<br/><font class="normalfont" style="color: #666666;">
Anybody who wants to run a survey.  Businesses.  Charities.  Associations and groups.  Think about all of your friends and family and you'll be surprised how many people might want to do a survey to learn about their market and generate some buzz.
</font>

<br/><br/>
<font class="mediumfont" style="color: #999999;">How do I get paid?</font>
<br/><font class="normalfont" style="color: #666666;">
As the organization pays bloggers and social people we'll add cash to your dNeero balance.  When your balance gets over $20 we'll send the money to your PayPal account overnight.

<br/><br/>
<font class="mediumfont" style="color: #999999;">How do I sell surveys?</font>
<br/><font class="normalfont" style="color: #666666;">
Start by reading the <a href='/researcher/index.jsp?showmarketingmaterial=1'>Researcher Basics</a> page.  It describes the benefits of a survey for organizations looking to use them.  Then explain to them what your experience has been with dNeero.
<br/><br/>
Next, get in touch with some businesses.  Use the phone book.  Go to networking events.  Talk to your friends and family.
</font>

<br/><br/>
<font class="mediumfont" style="color: #999999;">Is there a minimum sale size?</font>
<br/><font class="normalfont" style="color: #666666;">
A survey can cost as little as $100.
</font>

<br/><br/>
<font class="mediumfont" style="color: #999999;">Can this be my full time/part time job?</font>
<br/><font class="normalfont" style="color: #666666;">
Absolutely!  All we're really doing here is paying a sales commission to people who bring in sales.  Working at many companies as a salesperson you won't make that much, especially on media sales like this.  If you want to make $5000 each month you have to generate $50,000 in sales.  Some months that may happen as a single sale to a big marketing firm.  Other months that may happen as a bunch of smaller sales.

<br/><br/>
<font class="mediumfont" style="color: #999999;">What sort of businesses should I contact?</font>
<br/><font class="normalfont" style="color: #666666;">
We've found that most businesses can use Social Surveys. Consumer goods work well.  Products and services targeted to the youth/college/young adult demographic work well.
</font>

<br/><br/>
<font class="mediumfont" style="color: #999999;">What if nobody takes the survey?</font>
<br/><font class="normalfont" style="color: #666666;">
You don't get paid.  But don't worry, most of our surveys are selling out right now.  As long as the survey has a reasonably open target demographic and isn't looking for 8 billion respondents (because there aren't that many people on the planet) you should get paid.  The key here is that you get paid whenever a blogger or social person is paid through the survey that you sold.
</font>

<br/><br/>
<font class="mediumfont" style="color: #999999;">Can I say I work for dNeero?</font>
<br/><font class="normalfont" style="color: #666666;">
Unfortunately, no.  While we do love you (hugs), for legal reasons we can't have you out there representing yourself as being part of the dNeero organization.  What you can say is that you're a dNeero reseller.
