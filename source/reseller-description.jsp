<font class="mediumfont" style="color: #999999;">What is the Reseller Program?</font>
<br/><font class="normalfont" style="color: #666666;">
The dNeero Reseller Program allows you to sell dNeero conversations to organizations and earn 10% of whatever they spend to ignite the conversation.  For example, if they join a conversation and pay $1000 to social people through it then you'll earn $100.

<font class="mediumfont" style="color: #999999;">What do I need to do?</font>
<br/><font class="normalfont" style="color: #666666;">
The program is very simple for you to use.
<ol>
    <li><b>Tell organizations about dNeero.com</b>. Send them email.  Call them on the phone.  Hand out fliers on the street.  Create a viral video and post it to YouTube.  Think outside the box.</li>
    <li><b>Convince them to create a survey</b> of their own.  They may want to generate awareness about a product or service.  Or they may want to learn about their market.  You need to convince them to use dNeero to ignite conversations.</li>
    <li><b>Give the business your Reseller Code</b> and tell them to apply it in the last step of conversation creation.  Of course, they'll need a dNeero.com account.</li>
    <li><b>Sit back and relax</b>... any time the organization pays a social person through the conversation you'll earn money.  You'll see the amounts added to your dNeero balance automatically.</li>
</ol>

<font class="mediumfont" style="color: #999999;">How much do I get paid?</font>
<br/><font class="normalfont" style="color: #666666;">
You get paid 10% of whatever the conversations pay to bloggers and social people.  For example, if you sell a conversation that pays social people a total of $1000 you earn $100.

<br/><br/>
<font class="mediumfont" style="color: #999999;">Sounds good... how do I sign up?</font>
<br/><font class="normalfont" style="color: #666666;">
All you need is a dNeero account.  Anybody can join the Reseller Program!  Once you have a dNeero account you need to log in, click Account and find the Reseller Program link.  On that page you'll learn what your Reseller Code is.
</font>

<br/><br/>
<font class="mediumfont" style="color: #999999;">How is this different than the 'normal' dNeero where I make money?</font>
<br/><font class="normalfont" style="color: #666666;">
As a user of dNeero you normally make money joining conversations and posting them to your blog or social network profile.  With the Reseller Program you make money by getting organizations to pay to launch their own surveys.
</font>

<br/><br/>
<font class="mediumfont" style="color: #999999;">What do you mean by 'organization'?</font>
<br/><font class="normalfont" style="color: #666666;">
Anybody who wants to ignite a conversation.  Businesses.  Charities.  Associations and groups.  Think about all of your friends and family and you'll be surprised how many people might want to ignite a conversation to learn about their market and generate some buzz.
</font>

<br/><br/>
<font class="mediumfont" style="color: #999999;">How do I get paid?</font>
<br/><font class="normalfont" style="color: #666666;">
As the organization pays bloggers and social people we'll add cash to your dNeero balance.  When your balance gets over $20 we'll send the money to your PayPal account overnight.
</font>

<br/><br/>
<font class="mediumfont" style="color: #999999;">How do I sell surveys?</font>
<br/><font class="normalfont" style="color: #666666;">
Start by reading the <a href="/researcher/index.jsp?showmarketingmaterial=1">Conversation Igniter Basics</a> page.  It describes the benefits of igniting conversations for organizations looking to use them.  Then explain to them what your experience has been with dNeero.
<br/><br/>
Next, get in touch with some businesses.  Use the phone book.  Go to networking events.  Talk to your friends and family.
</font>

<br/><br/>
<font class="mediumfont" style="color: #999999;">Is there a minimum sale size?</font>
<br/><font class="normalfont" style="color: #666666;">
A conversation can cost as little as $100.
</font>

<br/><br/>
<font class="mediumfont" style="color: #999999;">Can this be my full time/part time job?</font>
<br/><font class="normalfont" style="color: #666666;">
Absolutely!  All we're really doing here is paying a sales commission to people who bring in sales.  Working at many companies as a salesperson you won't make the percentage we're willing to pay, especially on media sales like this.  If you want to make $5000 each month you have to generate $50,000 in sales.  Some months that may happen as a single sale to a big marketing firm.  Other months that may happen as a bunch of smaller sales.
</font>

<br/><br/>
<font class="mediumfont" style="color: #999999;">What if I'm an interactive firm/marketer?</font>
<br/><font class="normalfont" style="color: #666666;">
No problem.  You can get paid the same commission.  Call us if you have clients requiring conversations over $100,000... we may be able to work out bigger commissions for you.
</font>

<br/><br/>
<font class="mediumfont" style="color: #999999;">What sort of businesses should I contact?</font>
<br/><font class="normalfont" style="color: #666666;">
We've found that most businesses can use Social Surveys. Consumer goods work well.  Products and services targeted to the youth/college/young adult demographic work well.
</font>

<br/><br/>
<font class="mediumfont" style="color: #999999;">What if nobody takes the survey?</font>
<br/><font class="normalfont" style="color: #666666;">
You don't get paid.  But don't worry, most of our conversations are selling out right now.  As long as the conversation has a reasonably open target demographic and isn't looking for 8 billion respondents (because there aren't that many people on the planet) you should get paid.  The key here is that you get paid whenever a social person is paid through the conversation that you sold.
</font>

<br/><br/>
<font class="mediumfont" style="color: #999999;">Can I say I work for dNeero?</font>
<br/><font class="normalfont" style="color: #666666;">
Unfortunately, no.  While we do love you (hugs), for legal reasons we can't have you out there representing yourself as being part of the dNeero organization.  What you can say is that you're a dNeero reseller.
