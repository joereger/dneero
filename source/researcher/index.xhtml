                        <br/>
                        dNeero allows you to create multi-question surveys and pay bloggers to both respond to it and post their answers on their blogs.  You can include images, video and rich html in your survey for product photos, diagrams and whatever else you'd like the blogger to see and post to their blog.  The power in this approach is that respondents know that their answers will be viewed by their peers, a much more powerful force in their lives.  Results from dNeero's methodology give you a better sense of how a concept is portrayed in modern social networks.  dNeero also provides a means to track the movement of responses through small-scale social networks.  It's a new tool in the struggle to understand human behavior.

                        <br/>
                        Engage bloggers on their own turf for more accurate market data (<b>ethnographic research</b> - bloggers post to their blogs so you'll hear what they tell their peers about your product... not what they'll tell a researcher)
                        <br/><br/>
                        Generate product awareness while you collect data (<b>market research meets marketing</b>) - Each blogger who responds also has friends and family who read their blog.
                        <br/><br/>
                        Low risk, pay as you go: define max budget and <b>only pay for respondents and impressions that actually happen</b>
                        <br/><br/>
                        Quick and easy: <b>set up a campaign online in minutes</b>
                        <br/><br/>
                        <b>Full disclosure</b> that the blogger has been paid avoids misrepresentation and other ethical snafus
                        <br/><br/>
                        Customize the look of the survey to <b>include logos, product pictures, clickable links</b>, etc... survey taking meets guerilla marketing

                        <ol>
                        <li><b>Create a survey</b> composed of various question types (Text, Essay, Likert Scale, Matrix, Multiple Choice, etc.)</li>
                        <li><b>Define your target blogger demographic</b> by birthdate, gender, ethnicity, marital status, income, education, state, city, profession and politics.</li>
                        <li><b>Define how much you'll pay</b> for a survey response and how much you'll pay for 1000 posts of that survey response to a blog (CPM).  There are many incentive strategies you can implement.</li>
                        <li><b>dNeero will publicize your survey</b> and find bloggers who want to respond to it. You'll pay for only those responses and survey displays that happen.</li>
                        <li><b>dNeero tracks survey responses and blog impressions</b>, providing you with simple billing and results data</li>

                        <font class="mediumfont" style="color: #999999">dNeero Targets the Thought Leaders... the Outliers</font>
                        <br/>
                        Bloggers, by the nature of their activity, are thought leaders within their social network.  dNeero's concept focuses on these thought leaders.  In Tipping Point terminology these are the Mavens or Salespeople... those who bring knowledge and advocacy to their group.  dNeero is not well-suited to the discovery of trends across entire populations... there are better phone-based and polling-based tools out there for such projects.  dNeero gives you access to an increasingly-potent and somewhat-untouchable segment of society that uses technology to shape the opinions of others.
                        <br/><br/><br/>
                        <font class="mediumfont" style="color: #999999">Two Birds with One Stone</font>
                        <br/>
                        Create buzz while you collect valuable market intelligence.  By the nature of dNeero's model you are disclosing your research to the public.  This may not work for some projects.  But for many this is powerful way to see a concept's play in the real world.  It is a two-way interaction between you and your constituents. Books like The Cluetrain Manifesto argue persuasively that the organizations that will succeed in the future are the ones who are most able to embrace a transparent model of interaction with their constituents.  Consumers, voters and members are all screaming for meaningful input into the product design and policy processes of the organizations they patronize.  By creating smart dNeero campaigns that expose strategic elements at the right time while collecting valuable feedback your organization can gain a solid competitive advantage.

                        <font class="mediumfont" style="color: #999999">Research Data is More Accurate Because Peers are Involved</font>
                        <br/>
                        Research data gained through dNeero is more reflective of how people actually act in their peer group because the answers they provide will be shared on their blog or social network.  In many traditional forms of market research the subject is apt to provide an answer that seems appropriate to the researcher but is not the actual answer that they'll use with their peers.  As a researcher you're much more interested in how they present their beliefs and views to their peers because these views drive market adoption and purchasing decisions.

                        It's easy to create an account and build a survey.  You won't be charged until you launch a survey, at which point it will be obvious that you're about to be charged.  Log in. Explore.  Ask us questions.  It's a new concept and we're excited to see how you apply it!

                            <img src="/images/redbutton-disclosure.gif" align="left"/><br clear="all"/>All blog posts must disclose the fact that the blogger was paid to take the survey.  This ensures that the balance of trust in the blogosphere remains controlled by bloggers and their readers.  dNeero is dedicated to a free, excited and motivated blogosphere.  We want to bring researchers and marketers to the party and we want them to thrive, but we need to make sure they don't burn the couch before they go.

                            <img src="/images/redbutton-neutrality.gif" align="left"/><br clear="all"/>Bloggers are never required to post positive reviews.  dNeero defends the the blogger's freedom to thrash any product by forcing researchers to remain neutral.  This, of course, increases the quality of market research garnered by the process and avoids the sugging quagmire.  Paying people to be fake is not what dNeero is about.  In fact, the prospect of such companies terrifies us... they degrade the blogosphere and reduce the credibility of research done in it.

                            <img src="/images/redbutton-twoway.gif" align="left"/><br clear="all"/>Unlike other pay-for-blog schemes dNeero is a two-way process.  We'll stop short of claiming full Cluetrain credentials.  But the fact is that a researcher generates exposure and collects information from a market at the same time.  This is a first step to lowering the walls between the marketing department and the market research department.  dNeero believes that in the digital age outbound messaging and inbound communication should be united.  We didn't make this stuff up... go read Cluetrain.
