dNeero pays you to take surveys.  The twist is that you share your own answers with your friends.  Social surveys.

You earn taking the survey.  But you also earn by recruiting friends to the app.  If you recruit a user to take their first survey we pay you a percentage of what they earn out of our own pockets.  And then you get paid for the people they recruit... and those they recruit... up to five levels deep.  So start recruitin'!  It pays to be the first in your circle of friends to do dNeero!

You'll get paid via PayPal when your account balance is greater than $5.  To get paid for each survey you have to have somebody click from your profile and view your answers on 5 of the 10 days following when you took the survey.  Advertisers are paying for your opinion and for exposure of their concept.  It's a catch, but it requires no effort on your part and most profiles get visited many times each day by friends.  You've got 10 days to generate just 5 days with clicks.

Keep the app installed to see your balance increase and to see new surveys as we launch them.

This is a real company... we work with top-notch advertising and market research firms.  We consult with survey companies to write questions that are exciting and fun to take and share with your friends.  If you'd like to start a campaign to reach Facebook users just visit dNeero.com.

Thanks for taking part in Social Surveys!
