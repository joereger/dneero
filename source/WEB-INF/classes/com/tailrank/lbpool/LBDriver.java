/**
 * The lbpool project provides a load balancing JDBC driver for use with DB
 * connection pools.  It wraps a normal JDBC driver providing reconnect
 * semantics in the event of additional hardware availability, partial system
 * failure, or uneven load distribution.  It also evenly distributes all new
 * connections among slave DB servers in a given pool.  Each time connect() is
 * called it will attempt too use the best server with the least system load.
 * 
 * The biggest scalability issue with large applications that are mostly READ
 * bound is the number of transactions per second that the disks in your cluster
 * can handle.  You can generally solve this in two ways.
 * 
 * 1. Buy bigger and faster disks with expensive RAID controllers.
 * 2. Buy CHEAP hardware on CHEAP disks but lots of machines.
 * 
 * We prefer the cheap hardware approach and lbpool enables this functionality.
 * 
 * Even if you *did* manage to use cheap hardware most load balancing hardware
 * is expensive, requires a redundant balancer (if it were to fail), and seldom
 * has native support for MySQL.
 * 
 * The lbpool driver addresses all these needs.
 * 
 * The original solution was designed for use within MySQL replication clusters.
 * This generally involves a master server handling all writes with a series of
 * slaves which handle all reads.  In this situation we could have hundreds of
 * slaves and lbpool would load balance queries among the boxes.  If you need
 * more read performance just buy more boxes.
 * 
 * If any of them fail it won't hurt your application because lbpool will simply
 * block for a few seconds and move your queries over to a new production
 * server.
 * 
 * While currently designed for MySQL this could easily be updated to support
 * PostgresQL or any other DB that supports replication.
 * 
 * ** Scalability
 * 
 * In the current mechanism the driver should be able to scale to dozens and
 * hundreds of slave servers.  Generally speaking though everything has a limit
 * to which it can scale and lbpool is no exception.  
 * 
 * For 99% of deployed applications we should be able to scale very well outside
 * of the box.  The NDB cluster package from MySQL seems like the way forward
 * but until MySQL 5.1 is available with disk support this solution will be out
 * of the price range of most customers since it requires an data be held in
 * memory.
 *
 * Even with NDB there's a need to pool the NDB SQL nodes and even though the
 * data nodes support failover the client still connects to one SQL node. If
 * this were to crash the client would be offline.  Using lbpool along with NDB
 * would solve this problem but to date it hasn't been done.
 * 
 * ** Load balancing policy
 * 
 * When the client first boots we attempt to connect to the host with the best
 * chance of running our queries efficiently.  We use the number of concurrent
 * connections, load, and slave status to accomplish this.  We keep using this
 * host until our policy system determines that its no longer beneficial to do
 * so.  We use the following tests to determine if a host can is offline and can
 * no longer can be used.
 * 
 *  1. It physically goes away (hardware issue, or network connectivity issue)
 *  
 *  2. Replication breaks (from SHOW SLAVE STATUS output)
 * 
 *  3. Replication falls behind.
 * 
 *  4. The load on the box is too high.
 * 
 *  5. Has too many connections.
 * 
 * Most of the time the load on the box will be to high and we'll simply pick
 * another box and start running queries there.  After a few minutes the box
 * will probably correct and the system will continue functioning properly.
 * 
 *******************************************************************************
 * Features
 * 
 * - Runtime rebalancing.  If other JDBC drivers disconnect and leave the
 *   cluster unbalanced we attempt to rebalance the cluster.  Hosts are also
 *   rebalanced if they go offline and then become available again.  This helps
 *   evenly distribute load across teh cluster.
 * 
 * - Even if ALL the servers in your cluster go offline the driver can handle
 *   this and will block until at least ONE machine comes back online.  This
 *   means your application will just freeze and not break throwing
 *   SQLExceptions from broken servers.
 * 
 * - If a machine is flagged offline, existing connections will be disconnected
 *   from this slave and reconnected to another production machine (even if they
 *   are sitting idle on an webserver for hours).
 * 
 * - Since the configuration is dynamic (and done on the master) machines can be
 *   added or removed at anytime.  This can allow you to take a machine offline,
 *   reconfigure mysql (ALTER/REPAIR a table, etc), and then put it back online
 *   when maintenance is complete.
 * 
 * - If a slave physically goes offline it won't interrrupt service.  All
 *   internal exceptions are caught and the query is replayed on another server.
 * 
 * - If replication breaks or falls behind the existing connections will be
 *   re-connected to working MySQL boxes without any interruption in service.
 * 
 * - DB servers can be flagged offline and within the polling interval (default
 *   of 2 minutes) they will be removed from production.  This will allow you to
 *   run ALTER TABLE or REPAIR on production machines without affecting clients.
 *   Just remove them from production one at a time and your system shouldn't be
 *   affected.
 * 
 *******************************************************************************
 * Configuration 
 * 
 * 1. Create a db.mydomain.com DNS record with the IP address of your Master DB
 *    server
 *
 * 2. Update your JDBC driver URL to use the new syntax:
 * 
 *    lbpool:com.mysql.jdbc.Driver:db.tailrank.com:blogindex
 *
 *    You'll probably also need to add holdResultsOpenOverStatementClose in your
 *    connections string.  This is a feature I introduced as a patch and Mark
 *    Matthews re-implemented in the mainline JDBC driver.  Since MySQL 4.1
 *    results sets are just byte arrays we can cheat a bit and allow use of
 *    result sets even after a JDBC statement has been closed.
 *  
 * 3. Grant the MySQL REPLICATION CLIENT permission to the MySQL user the JDBC
 *    driver will connect as:
 * 
 *    GRANT REPLICATION CLIENT ON *.* TO 'blogindex'@'%.tailrank.com';
 *
 *******************************************************************************
 * Schema
 *******************************************************************************
 * 
 * The following schema needs to be setup on the master.  This tells lbpool
 * which hosts to use in production and allows you to flag hosts to go offline
 * if necessary. Note that it will take 60 seconds or so for lbpool to stop
 * using this host so its generally a good idea to flag if as offline and then
 * wait until no other lbpool instances are using it.
 * 
 * On your master exec:
 * 
 * CREATE DATABASE lbpool;
 * 
 * USE lbpool;
 * 
 * CREATE TABLE HOST
 * (
 *  ID INTEGER NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
 *  POOLNAME VARCHAR (40) NOT NULL,
 *  HOSTNAME VARCHAR (40) NOT NULL,
 *  OFFLINE BIT default 0,
 *  PRIMARY KEY(ID),
 *  UNIQUE (POOLNAME(40), HOSTNAME(40)),
 *  INDEX HOSTNAME (HOSTNAME(40))
 *  );
 * 
 * FIXME: add MAX_CONNECTIONS here... we don't want individual machines to get
 * overwhelmed.
 *
 * GRANT SELECT ON lbpool.* TO 'myuser'@'%.mydomain.com' IDENTIFIED BY 'mypasswd' ;
 *  
 * FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
 * 
 * **** 
 * Adding hosts
 * 
 * You can then run the following SQL to add hosts to your cluster:
 * 
 * USE lbpool;
 * INSERT INTO HOST (POOLNAME, HOSTNAME) VALUES ( 'web.db.mydomain.com', 'db3.mydomain.com' );
 * 
 * **** 
 * Marking hosts offline:
 * 
 * UPDATE HOST SET OFFLINE=1 WHERE HOSTNAME = 'db3.mydomain.com';
 * 
 *******************************************************************************
 * Future Development:
 * 
 * **
 * 
 * While very advanced the lbpool driver isn't perfect. If you're working with
 * highly heterogenous hardware the driver will attempt evenly distribute load
 * across the servers.  We need to build a load monitoring agent which will run
 * on each of the hosts and update the master schema.  This way the drivers can
 * throttle a host thats experiencing high load.
 *
 * To avoid this problme we advice you:
 * 
 * - Don't run custom SQL on a production load balance server.  Anything that
 *   will increase system load will affect cluster performance.  For example if
 *   you have a 3rd party application running it could cause system load to rise
 *   which will hurt the balancing algorithsm.  For example if you run 'find /'
 *   on a box thats production it will hurt the balanced performance.
 * 
 * - Support a new LOADFACTOR column so that we can distribute load by a factor
 *   so that certain hosts take more load.
 * 
 * ** 
 *
 * It would be nice to have event based (instead of poll based) monitoring of
 * slave status.  I'd like to know the SECOND a slave breaks so that I can mark
 * that host offline.  I'll probably need support from the MySQL server for this
 * to work.
 *

 * 
 * Support for MySQL multi-master replication:
 * 
 * See:
 * http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/replication-auto-increment.html
 * 
 * For more info.
 * 
 * 
 * Integrate commons-benchmark so I can export performance stats from this
 * package for monitoring purposes.

/**
 * 
 * TODO:
 *
 * - Sun Sep 30 2007 08:53 PM (burton@tailrank.com): new HEARTBEAT table which
 *   is a MEMORY table which allows EACH host to
 *
 *   It should probably look like:
 * 
 * 
 * - Measure mean throughput of executing SQL with the benchmark package.  If
 *   the profile of a certain box seems too high we should attempt to throttle
 *   it a bit.
 * 
 * - Right now load is NOT a factor in selecting the best host. I'm not even
 *   sure if this is used right now.
 * 
 * - Reconnect will NEVER happen if the load is TOO HIGH on a box.. we won't
 *   even have semantics for this.  Add it in the poller.
 * 
 * - I can simulate this by running a SELECT * FROM PENDING_POST_NODE and
 *   dumping it into a file.
 * 
 * - How do we do monitoring on this code?  If boxes are internally
 *   marked offline we need to send out a SMS page.
 * 
 * - Computing the load is a BIT difficult ...I can't use the TOTAL load because
 *   one or two connections might be taking a long time but not really hurting
 *   overall system performance.  I guess I should really assume if 80% of the
 *   current connections are > N seconds that its falling behind... how do I get
 *   this number to scale though.
 * 
 **** HISTORY ******************************************************************
 * 
 * - If a server is ADDED/REMOVED from production the load won't be re-balanced
 *   correctly
 * 
 * - When a box is flagged offline....... how quickly are the connections
 *   re-established and in WHAT thread?  it would be NICE if they were used
 *   right THEN.
 * 
 * - Strange networking tests we need to do:
 * 
 * - Test to make sure the lbdriver marks boxes offline when replication breaks.
 * 
 * - Mangled SQL won't take the whole cluster offline
 * 
 * - NO IP ADDRESSES(should work)
 * 
 * - Broken IP addresses (wrong servers)
 * - will behave as no servers
 * 
 * - Unable to connect to any hosts
 * - will spin on existing connections and throw exceptions on new connections.
 * 
 * - Hosts break at runtime.
 * 
 * - I did an /etc/init.d/mysql stop with one connection running against it
 * and it had NO problems... threw NO exceptions and just kept running fine.
 * 
 * - A host is REMOVED ... I think that if this happens existing boxes would STILL
 * be used which is a problem. The would need to be marked offline and not used
 * anymore.  This depends on the DNS configuration bug though.
 * 
 * - This is complete but we STILL need to test it...
