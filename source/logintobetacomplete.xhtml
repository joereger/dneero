                </div>
                <br/><br/>

                <table width="100%" cellpadding="5">
                <tr>
                <td valign="top">
                    <font class="smallfont" style="font-size: 13px;">
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Email Activation is Tricky in Beta</b>  -
                        After you create an account you have to get an email before you can log in.  When you click the link in the email you'll get the Beta login screen.  Log in, keep your browser open, and then click the link in the email again.  When we lift the Beta password protection this nuisance will dissappear.
                        <br/><br/></li>

                        <li><b>Click "Stay Logged In"</b>  -
                        After you activate your account and log in, check the "Stay Logged In" box.  It'll help you over some issues like the one above.
                        <br/><br/></li>

                        <li><b>We're a Financial Island</b>  -
                        We're not hooked-up to live financial systems so you can use a fake credit card number of "4111111111111111" (four plus fifteen ones).  You can also use a fake paypal address.  Go ahead, create that $300K survey!
                        <br/><br/></li>

                        <li><b>It's All Secret</b>  -
                        We probably don't even have to mention it, but everything you see is secret and shouldn't be shared with anybody.  Don't give out passwords, etc.  Thanks.
                        <br/><br/></li>

                        <li><b>All Data Will Be Erased</b>  -
                        Before we go live we'll erase all data.  Don't spend too long creating the perfect survey... but do get to know the system!
                        <br/><br/></li>

                        <li><b>It's Not You... It's the System</b>  -
                        If anything doesn't make sense, seems too difficult or appears just plain wacky... it's not you... it's the system.  If things are complicated, we're not doing our job well.  Tell us where we need to improve.
                        <br/><br/></li>

                <font class="mediumfont">And now, imagine that you're clicking on a link to dNeero.com for the very first time... you won't be logged-in yet (that beta password goes away once we launch to the public) so you'll have to learn about the site and then create an account.  Thanks for your help!</font>
